# HumanitySucks
This is a card game based in the popular card game Cards Against Humanity.
This is just a final course project, and are not related to the Cards Against Humanity owners.
In the moment this project was proposed, the following text was in the official Cards Against Humanity  FAQ web (in the FAQ's):

```
* - Do I have permission to make some crappy Cards Against
  Humanity thing like an all?

     whatever, but you have to give us credit, you can't profit from the use of
     out content (this mean ad revenue is not allowed), and you have to
     share whatever you make in the same way we share it (tjhis means you
     can't submit our content to any app store). We own the name "Cards
     Against Humanity", so you have to call your crappy thing something else.
